<p>Inspiration for this webpage came from looking at the the reccomeneded website http://mediaqueri.es/ and looking at the differences in the layouts that the webpages had as the screen size changed. <br> I also had a look at some of the websites that I use often to compare the responsiveness of the layouts.<br> https://www.ignant.com/ <br> http://www.booooooom.com/ <br> http://www.konbini.com/en/ <br> A common factor in these websites is that at mobile screen size, the layout changes with the elements set as block. This makes the website more readable to the user, changing to inline-block as the screen sizes get bigger. </p>

<p> In order to learn how to use the media query to create a responsive webpage I read through the PDF given out in class which gave detailed information. <br> I had previously used media queries in a class project last year in conjunction with the bootstrap framework. I pulled what I learnt about media queries from last year to try and make a responsive webpage without the use of bootstrap. <br> Reading through the linked website http://www.creativebloq.com/responsive-web-design/build-basic-responsive-site-css-1132756 helped to refresh the use of the queries to set different properties to elements at different screen sizes without recoding the entire website for each size change. </p>
